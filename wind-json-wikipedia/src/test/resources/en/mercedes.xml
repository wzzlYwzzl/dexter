In most cases (the [[Mercedes-Benz 600|600]] limousine being the exception), if neither &quot;E&quot; or &quot;D&quot; is present, the vehicle has a petrol engine with a carburettor.* &quot;G&quot; indicates the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Geländewagen]] off-road vehicle.* &quot;K&quot; was used in the 1930s, indicating a supercharger (&quot;Kompressor&quot;) equipped engine. One exception is the SSK, where K indicates &quot;Kurz&quot; (short-wheelbase).* &quot;L&quot; indicates &quot;Leicht&quot; (lightweight) for sporting models, and &quot;Lang&quot; (long-wheelbase) for sedan models.* &quot;R&quot; indicates &quot;Rennen&quot; (racing), used for racing cars (for example, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR|300SLR]]).* &quot;S&quot; Sonderklasse &quot;Special class&quot; for flagship models.* &quot;T&quot; indicates &quot;Touring&quot; and an estate (or station wagon) body style.Some models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters (b, c, and d) to indicate specific trim levels.For some models, the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement. This was done to show the model's position in the model lineup independent of displacement or in the price matrix. For these vehicles, the actual displacement in liters is suffixed to the model designation. For example, the [[Mercedes-Benz W201|190-class]] all had &quot;190&quot; for the numeric designation, regardless of the engine size, to indicate their entry-level status. Also, some older models (such as the SS and SSK) did not have a number as part of the designation at all.For the 1994 model year, Mercedes-Benz revised the naming system. Models were divided into &quot;classes&quot; denoted by an arrangement of up to three letters (see &quot;Current model range&quot; above), followed by a three-digit (or two-digit for AMG models, with the number approximately equal to the displacement in liters multiplied by 10) number related to the engine size, as before. Variants of the same model (such as an estate version, or a vehicle with a diesel engine) are no longer given a separate letter. In most cases, the class designation is arbitrary. The SLR and SLS supercars do not carry a numerical designation.As before, some models' numerical designations do not match the engine's actual displacement; in these cases the number shows the model's relative performance within the class. For example, the E250 CGI has greater performance than the E200 CGI because of different engine tuning, even though both have 1.8-litre engines. Recent AMG models use the &quot;63&quot; designation (in honor of the 1960s 6.3-litre [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]] engine) despite being equipped with either a 6.2-litre ([[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|M156]]) or 5.5-litre ([[Mercedes-Benz M278 engine|M157]]) engine.Some models carry further designations indicating special features:* &quot;4MATIC&quot; indicates the vehicle is equipped with [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel-drive]].* &quot;[[BlueTec|BlueTEC]]&quot; indicates a diesel engine with [[selective catalytic reduction]] exhaust aftertreatment.* &quot;BlueEFFICIENCY&quot; indicates special fuel economy features (direct injection, [[start-stop system]], aerodynamic modifications, etc.)* &quot;CGI&quot; (Charged Gasoline Injection) indicates [[Direct fuel injection|direct gasoline injection]].* &quot;CDI&quot; (Common-rail Direct Injection) indicates a [[Common rail|common-rail]] diesel engine.* &quot;Hybrid&quot; indicates a gasoline- or diesel-electric [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]].* &quot;NGT&quot; indicates a natural gas-fueled engine.* &quot;Kompressor&quot; indicates a [[supercharger|supercharged]] engine.* &quot;Turbo&quot; indicates a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, only used on A-, B-,Е- and GLK-Class models.All model designation badges can be deleted upon the customer's request.===Environmental record===Mercedes-Benz has developed multi [[concept vehicle|concept cars]] with alternative propulsion, such as hybrid-electric, fully electric, and fuel-cell powertrains.
