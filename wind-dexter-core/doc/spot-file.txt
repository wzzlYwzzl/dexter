SPOT FILE 

the spot-src-target file (data/spot/spot-src-target.tsv.gz) contains  

spot <tab> e-src <tab> e-target 

the spot file (data/spot/spos.tsv.gz)  contains

spot <tab> <target entities id separaded by commas and delta-encoded>  <tab> <link frequency> <tab> <document frequency> 

where <link frequency> is the number of documents containing the anchor text 
while <document frequency> is the number of documents containing the spot text as anchor or pure text. 

Please, note that sometimes link frequency is a bit higher than document frequency (and this is weird, it should not happen)
this is due to the fact that some spot don't really exists on wikipedia, but are obtained refined other spots 
for example for Johathan K. Kennedy we also generate johathan kennedy removing the middle K..
When we do this, we keep the original link frequency, but the document frequency is recomputed. 

also the document frequency is computed using lucene and counting the number of results for the query <spot> 
so this may be a bit imprecise. 

TODO doc frequency should be moved in another file
